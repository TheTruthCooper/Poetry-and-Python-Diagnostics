# # This assumes working knowledge of how to structure file systems on a repository with .git

# Where to Implement 

## Folder Structure

To effectively manage this script within your project, follow this folder structure:

```
project-root/
│
├── scripts/
│   └── validate_environment.py  # Place the main Python script here
│
├── README.md  # General project README
├── pyproject.toml  # Poetry configuration file
├── poetry.lock  # Poetry lock file with exact versions of installed packages
├── diagnostics_report.txt  # (Optional) Diagnostics report file generated by the script
│
└── src/  # Your source code folder
    └── ...  # Other project files and folders
```

## Git Integration

- Add the `validate_environment.py` script to your git repository under the `scripts/` directory.
- Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes the `diagnostics_report.txt` file, so it's not accidentally committed:

  ```
  diagnostics_report.txt
  ```

## Deployment Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure the script is used only in development environments, not in production.
- **Automation**: This script can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate environment checks before deployment.

## Recommended Usage

- **Development**: Run this script when setting up the environment for the first time or after pulling updates that may change dependencies.
- **Troubleshooting**: Use the script to diagnose issues with dependency management or environment configuration in your Poetry-based projects.
